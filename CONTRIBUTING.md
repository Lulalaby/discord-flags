# Contribution Guidelines

You want to submit some flags? Great! Here's a couple guidelines for you.

-   When possible, prefer **official** documentation over our hand-written stuff, even if it looks
    stupid. Yes, `HOUSE_BRAVERY` is better, but the official term is `HYPESQUAD_ONLINE_HOUSE_1`.
    Think of this project as a secondary source of truth; we gather our resources from our primary
    sources first, and then we write our own deductions/knowledge last.
    -   The only exception is the descriptions for flags. Our ones tend to be better (not to toot our
        own horn) since they're simplified versions of the official descriptions or are our own deduction.
-   Provide evidence of your research. This is something this project has lacked for a little while
    and is something we should really be in the habit of doing. If we need to go back to work out how
    a flag was discovered, how it was named, etc., then this is the only way how.

When I said a couple, I meant a couple. That's it pretty much.
